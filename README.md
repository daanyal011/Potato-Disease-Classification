# Potato Disease Classification

This repository contains code for classifying potato diseases using deep learning techniques. The code is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is located in the directory `/content/drive/MyDrive/Potato disease classification/Training/Plan`. It consists of images of potato plants affected by various diseases.

## Code Overview

The code follows the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries and modules.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset using the TensorFlow `image_dataset_from_directory` function.
3. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
4. Define the model architecture using the TensorFlow Keras API.
5. Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
6. Train the model on the training dataset and evaluate it on the validation dataset.
7. Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss curves using Plotly.
8. Perform predictions on a sample of the testing dataset and visualize the results.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Set the path to the dataset directory in the code.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters such as image size, batch size, and number of epochs if desired.
4. Run the code.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 99.48% on the testing dataset. The training and validation accuracy and loss curves are visualized using interactive plots generated by Plotly.

Sample predictions are also provided, showing the predicted class, actual class, and confidence level for each image in the testing dataset.
